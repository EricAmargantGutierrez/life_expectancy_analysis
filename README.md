# Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic Factors

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how socio-economic factors impact life expectancy across the world using World Bank data. The goal was to identify key drivers and build a predictive model.

**Dataset Source:** [Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic World Bank (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank)

## Steps
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Regression Analysis
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Regularization with Ridge/Lasso)

## Key Insights
- Region and Income Group were the strongest predictors of life expectancy.
- Sub-Saharan Africa had a significant negative coefficient.
- Undernourishment showed a negative correlation with life expectancy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank).
2. Upload the dataset and open the `life_expectancy_analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure all libraries are installed (`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`).
4. Run the cells sequentially.
