Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic Factors
Project Overview
This project analyzes how socio-economic factors impact life expectancy across the world using World Bank data. The goal was to identify key drivers and build a predictive model.
Dataset Source: Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic World Bank (Kaggle)
Steps
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical Regression Analysis
Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Regularization with Ridge/Lasso)
Clustering with K-Means
Key Insights
Region and Income Group were the strongest predictors of life expectancy.
Sub-Saharan Africa had a significant negative coefficient.
Undernourishment showed a strong negative correlation with life expectancy.
Technologies Used
Python
